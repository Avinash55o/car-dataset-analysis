# Car Analysis

Welcome to the Car Analysis project! This repository contains an analysis of car data, focusing on features like price (MSRP), engine power (horsepower), weight, and fuel efficiency. We use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to clean the data, explore it, and create visualizations.

## Introduction

The Car Analysis project helps us understand the car market and how different features affect car performance. By looking at key features, we can find patterns and insights that are useful for car buyers and industry experts.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about cars, such as:
- Make and Model
- Price (MSRP) and Invoice
- Engine Size and Number of Cylinders
- Horsepower and Weight
- Fuel Efficiency (MPG in City and Highway)
- Origin and Drive Type

## Installation

To run the analysis, make sure you have Python and these packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Analysis

In this project, we:
- Clean the data by removing unwanted characters and filling in missing values.
- Look at basic statistics to understand the data better.
- Check how different features are related using a correlation matrix.
- Find the top 5 most expensive cars.
- Create visualizations to show key insights.

## Visualizations

We create several visualizations, including:
- **MSRP vs Horsepower**: A scatter plot to see how price relates to engine power.
- **Distribution of City MPG**: A histogram showing how fuel efficiency varies in the city.
- **Average MSRP by Origin**: A bar chart comparing average prices based on where the cars are from.
- **Comparison of Weight, Horsepower, and MPG City**: A grouped bar chart for selected car models.
-**Count the no of cars by Origin**: A pie chart camparing the count of cars based on the origin
