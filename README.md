## Introduction

The Car Analysis project aims to provide valuable insights into the automotive market and vehicle performance metrics. By analyzing key features of cars, we can uncover trends, correlations, and other important information that can aid in decision-making for consumers and industry professionals alike.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of cars, such as:
- Make and Model
- MSRP and Invoice
- Engine Size and Cylinders
- Horsepower and Weight
- MPG (City and Highway)
- Origin and DriveTrain

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Data Cleaning: Removing unnecessary characters and handling missing values.
- Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics and data shape.
- Correlation Matrix: Understanding relationships between numeric features.
- Top 5 Most Expensive Cars: Identifying high-end models.
- Visualizations: Various plots to illustrate key insights.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations:
- **MSRP vs Horsepower**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between price and engine power.
- **Distribution of City MPG**: Histogram of city fuel efficiency.
- **Average MSRP by Origin**: Bar chart comparing average prices by car origin.
- **Comparison of Weight, Horsepower, and MPG City**: Grouped bar chart for selected car models.
